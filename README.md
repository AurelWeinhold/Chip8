Chip 8
===

A simple [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) Emulator written in C++.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to learn how to program in C++, learn the principles of writing
emulators and everything that is correlated, like memory management and instruction execution.
Additionally I am pushing myself to practice using and learn more about
[GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/), [cmake](https://cmake.org/), and other (C++) related tools on
the fly.
